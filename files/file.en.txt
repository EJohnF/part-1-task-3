Let us enjoy reading this story of The Dog and The Cows.

The cows used to eat hay from the manger. One day a herd of cows came to the manger to eat hay. They saw a dog lying on the hay in the manger.

One of the cows pleaded, "Please, will you get up! We are hungry. We have to eat our hay". The dog did not take heed of it.

Once again another cow pleaded, "Please, let us have our hay". The dog snarled and the cow stepped back.

A wise cow ran up to the bull and told him the matter.

The bull came and requested, "Get out, please! Let them have their food". There was no reply. The bull became angry. He bellowed loudly and stamped his legs. The dog got frightened and ran for his life.

MORAL : It is no good to be a dog in a manger.
